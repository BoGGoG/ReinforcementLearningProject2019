# ReinforcementLearningProject2019: Playing UNO

We are building a reinforcement learning agent to play the card game UNO.
This is a project for the lecture "[Reinforcement Learning](https://www.fias.science/en/neuroscience/research-groups/jochen-triesch/teaching/)" in the summer semester 2019 at GU Frankfurt.

The book used in the lecture is

Structure:
- **Uno engine** to handle the game,
- **Agents** who recieve a game state and return an action,
- **Arena** to handle the interface between engine and agents
